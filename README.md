## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of this Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fonts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ music/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AsideMenu.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CardPlayButton.jsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Greeting.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Player.jsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ PlaylistItemCard.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SideMenuCard.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SideMenuItem.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Slider.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ SongsTable.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ icons/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ colors.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ data.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ playlist/
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [id].astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
